### Getting started with git
"[git](https://git-scm.com/)" is version control system that lets us sychronize development with other people and over time.  We will use it to make a local copy of the shellypyserver project, track our changes, and synchronize our work with each other. 



To get  our project, open a terminal to the location you want to work from (e.g." c:/data/git) and type:
```cmd
https://github.com/bhlarson/shellypyserver.git
```
Next open the directory in [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

If you are a shellypyserver developer, add your name to the list in the "Developers" section below, add your changes to git, commit your changes, and push them to github as follows:
```cmd
git status
git pull
git add README.md
git commit -m "Adding Brad Larson to developers"
git push
```
