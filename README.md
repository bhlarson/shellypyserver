1. Create a python web server from scratch serving static web pages
1. Add to the API of a joint web server
1. Add a new Shelly device interface to the the web server
1. Add an on/off device control to the server web page
1. Receive a device event
1. Publish the device event though the web interface
1. Display the device event on the web page

## Instructions
### Getting with git
[git](https://git-scm.com/) is version control system that lets us sychronize development with other people and over time.  We will use it to make a local copy of the shellypyserver project, track our changes, and synchronize our work with each other. To get  our project, open a terminal to the location you want to work from (e.g. c:/data/git) and type:
```cmd
https://github.com/bhlarson/shellypyserver.git
```
Next open the directory in [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

If you are a shellypyserver developer, add your name to the list in the "Developers" section below, add your changes to git, commit your changes, and push them to github as follows:
```cmd
